## Geting started
Step 1 – Install Node.js
Head on over to http://nodejs.org and click install – this should use magic to figure out what OS and version.

Step 2 – Install Gulp.js
gulp-2x Open command prompt – (run cmd) then type ‘npm’ – if there is no  error you’ve installed Node.js correctly yay! Otherwise make sure you close and reopen command prompt if it was open during install. Or try rebooting – reinstalling, the usual.

Now type ‘npm install -g gulp’ this will install Gulp.js globally on your system. It will enable you to run the ‘gulp’ command in your command prompt.

Step 3:
Run ‘gulp’ in the project folder to build the project

Other availeble gulp commands:
- gulp watch


## Develop:
- Open test/index.debug.html in any browser.
- Run 'gulp watch' in the project folder
- Open visual studio code or your favorite editor and start editing!
- Using live-reload or fefresh after auto build on save

## TODO
